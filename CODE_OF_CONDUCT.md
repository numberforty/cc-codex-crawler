## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone. We pledge to act and
interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and
healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness to others
- Being respectful of differing opinions and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments
- Personal or political attacks

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable
behavior and will take appropriate corrective action in response to any
behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive behavior can be reported privately to the maintainers at
<email@example.com>. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will
result in a response that is appropriate to the circumstances.
